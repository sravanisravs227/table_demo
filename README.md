 Short Report: Comparison and Use Case Recommendation:

The three blockchains—Ethereum (public), Hyperledger Fabric (private), and R3 Corda (consortium)—each serve different purposes based on their design and capabilities.

**Ethereum** is a public, open blockchain supporting smart contracts in Solidity and a native token (ETH). It is ideal for decentralized apps due to its openness and developer community, though it has lower throughput (\~30 TPS) compared to others.

**Hyperledger Fabric** is a private, permissioned blockchain with high performance (\~3000 TPS) and modular architecture. It supports smart contracts in multiple languages and is best suited for enterprise use like supply chains, where participants are known and privacy is needed.

**R3 Corda** operates in a consortium model with a focus on privacy and secure communication between known financial institutions. It doesn’t have a native token but supports complex business workflows with smart contracts in Java or Kotlin.

Recommendations:

* For a **decentralized app**, choose **Ethereum** for its public access and smart contract ecosystem.
* For a **supply chain among known partners**, use **Hyperledger Fabric** for its permissioned, high-performance setup.
* For an **inter-bank financial application**, choose **R3 Corda** due to its privacy model and financial sector optimization.
